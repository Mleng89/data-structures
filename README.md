## If you would like to run this repo on your machine:

First you must clone the repo onto your machine:

-   In your terminal, find a place you would like to store this repo and run this line: `git clone https://github.com/Mleng89/data-structures.git`

Running it after cloning:

-   In your terminal you can then run: `cd data-structures` and `code .` to open it in your favorite IDE!

Installing dependencies:

-   Now when the folder is open, run `yarn install` to install Jest as this will be using Jest to run tests!

Running the tests:

-   In order for you to run tests, you can enter `yarn/npm test` this will run jest on all test files.
-   To run single test files, run `yarn/npm test -- [file name]`.

### You may also open an issue if you would like to have a discussion or if you have any feedback!

### Notes to self on running C# with VSC:

1. `dotnet --version` (to make sure dotnet is installed)
2. `dotnet new console -o <name>` (to create C# project, can use other apps instead of console)
3. To execute console application code, user should be in designated folder. Then write `dotnet run` in terminal.
4. `>.NET Generate Assets for Build and Debug` CMD -> Command Palette
5. `dotnet build` (to compile code, will have exe or dll in /bin folder after.)
